"""Regression tests for default_message_mode (PR #1062, closes #720).

Pins the wiring for the three modes (queue / interrupt / steer):
- The setting key + default + enum validation in api/config.py
- Three slash commands registered in static/commands.js
- send()'s busy branch reads window._defaultMessageMode and dispatches
- Boot initializes window._defaultMessageMode from settings
- 17 new i18n keys present in all 6 locale blocks

Issue: #720 (configurable busy-input behaviour)
