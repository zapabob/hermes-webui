"""Regression locks for #4970 round 6: stream-end worklog collapse shrink jump.

Round 7 (scoping fix): the keep-open exception must apply to ONLY the turn that
just settled, gated on a one-shot stream-id token, NOT to every historical
settled worklog on every re-render.

Round 8 (mobile unpinned fix, #MOBILESCROLL follow-up): the keep-open exception
must also cover the UNPINNED reader who scrolled up to read inside the
just-settled turn. The earlier round scoped keep-open to pinned followers only,
on the assumption that unpinned readers "preserve their viewport normally". That
holds on desktop (overflow-anchor:none + JS snapshot restore) but NOT on mobile:
the CSS resting value is overflow-anchor:auto and _fixMobileScrollJank() flips an
inline overflow-anchor:none over the settle render, so native anchoring is
suppressed during the one frame the unpinned reader needs it to absorb the
above-viewport worklog shrink — the content leaps to the top of the turn (the
"往回大跳" report). Keeping the just-settled worklog open removes the shrink for
every device/anchor-mode, so the helper now returns true for the armed turn
regardless of pin state.

These tests are BEHAVIORAL: they extract the real
`_shouldKeepSettledWorklogOpenForStreamSettle` helper plus its arm/disarm token
API from static/ui.js and execute them in Node, then drive two settled turns and
assert the second (historical) turn collapses while the just-settled one stays
open for both pin states.
