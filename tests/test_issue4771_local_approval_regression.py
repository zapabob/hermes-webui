"""Regression tests for the #4771 follow-up: a LOCAL (in-process agent)
approval must NOT be refused with the gateway "active run is unavailable" 409.

Background
----------
#4771 ("keep gateway approval failures actionable") added an explicit 409
relay-failure response in ``_handle_approval_respond`` for the case where a
*gateway* approval is mirrored into WebUI polling state but its gateway run is
gone (no ``_STREAM_RUN_IDS`` entry). That keeps the approval card actionable on
a gateway-backed deployment instead of silently failing.

The regression: on the DEFAULT local in-process backend, every guarded command
parks an ``_ApprovalEntry`` in ``tools.approval._gateway_queues`` (via
``_await_gateway_decision``), and the local streaming path mirrors it into
``_pending`` with ``_GATEWAY_MIRROR_FLAG`` set — but there is no gateway run and
no ``_STREAM_RUN_IDS`` entry, by design. ``_gateway_pending_approval_without_run_id``
therefore returned True for that purely local approval, and the handler 409'd
("Gateway approval could not be relayed because the active run is unavailable"),
refusing to resolve an approval that resolves perfectly well locally. Users on
the local backend hit this on *every* approval click.

The fix gates the 409 on the WebUI actually running the gateway chat backend
(``webui_gateway_chat_enabled``), so local approvals fall through to the local
resolution path while the legitimate #4771 gateway behaviour is preserved.

These tests drive the real ``_handle_approval_respond`` handler and assert:
  - LOCAL backend  -> 200, approval resolved, agent thread unblocked (the fix)
  - GATEWAY backend -> 409 preserved when a mirrored approval has no run (#4771)
